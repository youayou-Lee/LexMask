"""Pin LocateAnything remote-code attention onto a DCU-viable implementation.

Issue #41. The LocateAnything remote code defaults the text tower to ``magi``
(``text_attn_impl ... or 'magi'``); when magi_attention is missing it trusts
transformers' ``is_flash_attn_2_available()``, which returns True whenever a
flash_attn package merely *imports* — the locateanything deps venv ships one
whose kernels do not work on DCU. The bundled forward only implements ``magi``
and ``sdpa`` (modeling_qwen2.py raises NotImplementedError for everything
else), so the wrong pick is not a slowdown but a guaranteed crash on every
generate(): dcu-main logged 0 successful /detect calls out of 2838 while
/health kept reporting online.

``sdpa`` is the only implementation the bundled forward fully supports here.
The decoder layers snapshot ``config._attn_implementation`` in ``__init__`` to
choose the attention class, so the pin must land on the config object *before*
the model is constructed — fixing attributes afterwards swaps a flag the
already-built attention modules never re-read.

Deliberately stdlib-only (no torch/transformers import) so it stays unit
testable in CI and importable from any entrypoint.
