"""Residual pass token-boundary + char-coverage (R3).

Pure-logic offline tests for _block_residual_ink plus one end-to-end proof
that a merged two-column block is actually re-asked.

The old "已消费" test was bare containment: any(value in block or block in
value). It let a single recalled value swallow a merged two-column block, so
the second column's value never reached the residual re-ask. The new identity
carves out only ISOLATED-TOKEN occurrences and keeps the block alive while it
still holds a value-sized run of unexplained ink.

(File named *multi_field* so the vision regression -k selector collects it.)
