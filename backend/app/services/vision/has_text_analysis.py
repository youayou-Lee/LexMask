# NER runs on the whole document, not per-line chunks: feeding the 0.6B model a
# context-free single cell (a lone "汉族") makes it force-fit that value into the
# nearest requested type when its true type isn't in the schema (民族 absent ->
# "汉族" lands under 性别). With the full page it has the context to assign 男->性别
# and leave 汉族 out — 找到就找到，找不到就没有。Tradeoff: the model dilutes recall on a
# long page and may drop an entity near the very end (e.g. a standalone signature
# date). Reordering/chunking to recover it reintroduces the force-fit, because this
# model classifies sequentially — order and recall are coupled. Dates were once
# force-recalled by a 年月日 regex backstop (both digit systems); a 5/5 reliability
# probe — including the CJK-digit "一九五八年九月十日" the backstop was written for —
# showed HaS now returns every date deterministically, so the regex was deleted.
# The model judges what is a date; no hand-written pattern enumerates them.

    the caller wires temperature/sample-index per index (HaSClient.ner takes
    both; the sample-index cache key keeps a temp>0 pass from being served the
    seed's cached result and collapsing the union to a single 趟). This function
    only owns the union + seed + stopping arithmetic.

    Leak-safety (0 new leaks):
      * The union is monotone non-decreasing — values only ever accumulate, so
        it is always a SUPERSET of pass 0, i.e. of today's deterministic output.
      * Convergence ("this pass added no new value") is ONLY a budget signal to
        stop spending GPU — never evidence the page is clean. It is checked only
        for passes after the seed, and it never rolls back the union already
        gathered.
      * Hallucinated values sampled at temp>0 stay in the union; the downstream
        matcher is the leak-safe gate — it yields 0 region for any value that
        does not occur in the OCR blocks. Growing the union cannot uncover PII.
