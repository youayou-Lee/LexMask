        Every look-alike the old pixel gates chased — a page-holding finger read
        as a seal, a red underline read as a fingerprint, a camera/APP watermark
        read as an edge seal — is ONE failure: the grounding model localised its
        target inside a context-rich crop and, obliged to point somewhere, boxed
        the most salient thing. The separator is physical and it is the model's
        own: re-ground the box's OWN claimed type on JUST its tight crop, context
        stripped. A real seal/print/signature still reads as itself (the re-ground
        is idempotent); a finger/underline/watermark had no stamp there at all and
        returns nothing once its borrowed context is gone. This is EXISTENCE, not
        a confidence score — real signatures re-ground at 0.16; a threshold would
        erase them, their existence would not. It generalises to every type with
        zero per-type pixel rules, and it replaces the whole gate pile (skin-hue,
        fill, chroma, ink-snap, cluster-grow) that each covered one look-alike and
        none the rest. Only grounding-sourced boxes pass through here; the YOLO
        detector is a separate trained model, precise on its own. Any decode/HTTP
        failure fails OPEN (keep the box) — a missed redaction outranks a false one.

        Signatures are NOT verified: re-grounding a real handwritten name on its
        own tight crop is unreliable — measured on 保姆, the 甲方/乙方 names return
        n=0 on a tight crop yet n=1 on a slightly wider one, so a real name whose
        detected box is tight WOULD be dropped (a leak). The recovered false
        signatures on blank margins are the price of that safety; they are
        over-mask (redact a blank strip, leak nothing). Signatures pass untouched.

        Fingerprints ARE verified (precision-first policy, 容许找不到但不要高FP):
        the pixel skin gate is gone, so re-grounding each print's own tight crop
        is the model-centric filter that prunes context-artifact false prints
        (a red underline / seal edge the model boxed as 指纹). A real ink print
        re-grounds on its crop; the residual page-holding-finger FP is the one
        the model cannot separate by texture and is left to a dedicated detector.
